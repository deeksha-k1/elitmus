# House of Burgundy, game by Sam Sinz

## Why I chose this game?

Having lived a few years in a village in Burgundy, I have always been amazed by the endless exploring opportunities of a seemingly dull place.
For this project, I have decided to develop a scavenger hunt-type game where the user helps Sam find his friend in the village. By discovering the area and its mysteries, the user picks up essential items and is given side quests by colorful characters.

## Key features

- Enthralling scenario and context
- User interactivity
- Smooth animations

## What's next?

- Comment and refactor
- Add locations, quests, items..
